# MicroSponsor

MicroSponsor is a decentralized platform built on the Stacks ecosystem that revolutionizes educational funding by connecting micro-donors directly with students. Through blockchain technology, we ensure transparent, accountable, and efficient distribution of educational funds while fostering meaningful connections between donors and students.

## Overview

MicroSponsor leverages blockchain technology to create a trustless environment where students can receive micro-scholarships based on their academic performance and achievements. The platform implements smart contracts for conditional fund disbursement and provides comprehensive progress tracking for both donors and students.

## Features

### For Students
MicroSponsor provides students with tools to create verified academic profiles, showcase their achievements, and connect with potential donors. Students can set academic milestones, receive funds based on achievement completion, and build a verifiable portfolio of their academic journey.

### For Donors
Donors can browse verified student profiles, make flexible micro-donations, and track the direct impact of their contributions. The platform provides real-time progress updates, transparent fund allocation tracking, and tax documentation generation.

### Smart Contract Implementation
Our platform utilizes Stacks smart contracts to ensure:
- Milestone-based fund release
- Automated academic performance verification
- Secure multi-signature approval systems
- Transparent fund allocation
- Emergency protocols for fund management
